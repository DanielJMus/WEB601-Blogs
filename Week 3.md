# Week 3

This week we are working through the HTML Codecademy course that covers both HTML and CSS. I have actually completed this course before back in college, and am faily confident in my regular HTML abilities, although I know this course will be going much further than just regular HTML and CSS, as we will be covering a lot of javascript libraries like React.

We have also began discussing javascript, Ali covered Javascript Operators which allow for conditionals to be created in code, these operators include things such as:

| Operator | Usage |
| \|\| | OR Operator (if x === true \|\| y === true) |
| && | AND Operator (if x === true && y === true) |
| ! | NOT Operator (if !x) |
| > | GREATER Operator (if x > y) |
| < | LESS Operator (if x < y) |

Operators are extremely useful, and are often the same in most programming languages, I'm mostly familiar with C# and the operators are exactly the same as they are here, which makes them very easy to remember and use for me.

Codecademy also has a ReactJS course, which we will likely also be working through after we finish the basics.
