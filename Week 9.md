# Week 9

This week we started looking into SQL, and how it is interacted with through API calls. Ali introduced us to a program called Postman, which is used to make API calls and then read information about the response within a simple interface, without having to write any code.

We also had to install various SQL tools such as MySQL Workbench, which I already had set up from the SDV course. We then wrote some basic SQL code in order to create a database within MySQL Workbench which was easy enough. We were shown how to generate dummy data too which I had never done before, which allows you to generate large amounts of randomized SQL data in order to populate a table for testing, which is very useful.

Ali also showed us how to actually make these calls in javascript using an api.js file, in which we would send an API call and then output the API response code (Such as 200, 201, 404, etc).

I'm somewhat familiar with a lot of the fundamentals behind this stuff already which is good, as it means that I can easily see what is being done in the example code and how the API calls are set up and handled.
