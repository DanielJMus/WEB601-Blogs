# Week 14

This week I have started the work to implement Redux into my app, at first I thought that Redux would require large portions of my app to be re-written and that it would be an extremely messy task, but from what I can tell now it seems as though Redux is simply some extra backend files that don't require much major refactoring of the existing code, which is a relief.

I'm still not 100% on Redux, I understand what it does but I'm not entirely sure how I will implement it in my app, one obvious solution would be to handle the user login with Redux as that way I will be able to store the user authentication in the Redux state, so I will likely aim to do that over the next couple of weeks.

Due to OSA now finishing up, I had 2 assignments due this week, and therefore haven't been able to work on my site too much, but now that OSA has finished I can focus fully on WEB (and SDV, but that's not too difficult). I'm hoping that I will get a solid grasp on Redux after a little bit of work with it this week, we've been creating examples in class so I can reference those whenever I need to for my app luckily.
