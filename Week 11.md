# Week 11

This week we have come back from our term break, we mostly just focused on getting our Milestone 2 work completed as that is due very soon. Other than that we also did some Pair Programming, which is where two people sit at a work station, and one will program what the other person says. Pair programming is beneficial because it allows one person to teach the other, teaching being a good way to solidify ones understanding of a topic because they will have to articulate it well enough that the other person can understand what they should be doing, and why they are doing it.

I would say that personally I program better alone than when I am working with another person, but I can definitely see the benefits of pair programming and how it can be useful for people to learn and be good at.

That's pretty much it for this week anyhow, I am just about finished with milestone 2 now so I am looking forward to getting that done, I've pretty much sorted out everything I am doing for it and know what code I still need to write, so it's just down to sitting down and writing it which hopefully won't take too long.
