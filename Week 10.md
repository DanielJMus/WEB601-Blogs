# Week 10

This week was more work on Milestone 2, so I have been doing a lot of work on that in order to get it done in time, 

This week we set up some MySQL example databases so that we can start to pull data from a database into our sites. Luckily I have done a lot of SQL in the past so a lot of this stuff is fairly familiar to me, although I've never implemented it within Javascript before. We were given an example project however, which doesn't seem like it should be too hard to set up ourselves.

In our app, we are to implement the four CRUD methods for databases in order to interact with the data, these methods are:

| Name | Description
| -- | -- |
| Create | Add (POST) data to the database |
| Read | Read (GET) data from the database |
| Update | Update existing data within the database |
| Delete | Delete data from the database |

Most of these are done with fairly similar code, so I don't think this should be too hard to set up within our apps, as once you've gotten one to work you can easily reuse that code in order to implement the others.
