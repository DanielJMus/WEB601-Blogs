# Week 15

## Reflections and closing statements

The final week is finally here, and all of our assessments are finally coming to a close. I've already finished all of my OSA classes so now all that is left is WEB and SDV.

In terms of WEB, I have finally gotten my login system working with Redux, which I am very happy about as I was starting to get pretty stressed not being able to figure it out, now that that's implemented I feel like I have a much better understanding of it and would probably be able to implement it in other places if I really wanted to, but just so I don't make a mess of my project I will likely keep it as-is for now and just focus on meeting all the requirements of Milestone 3.

While I felt extremely overwhelmed when we first started doing React and Redux work, I've come to appreciate both of them for what they are. I will certainly be trying to utilize them in my own personal projects from now on rather than just doing the simple html+css+js route.

I think despite the large difficulty spike in this course compared to the previous WEB courses at NMIT, I can definitely see why it is important that this stuff is being taught now; it is very relevant and modern information that will likely be extremely useful when we start job hunting, it feels as though the WEB course became a lot more relevant this year and I think that is a very good thing, we weren't just learning the bare basics of HTML like previous years.

Either way, only one week left until we must hand in WEB601, and I'm finally confident that I will be able to do so! But for now, back to work.
