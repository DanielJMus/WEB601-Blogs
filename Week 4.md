# Week 4

This week we were introduced to Node.js and the Node Package Manager (npm), 
Node.js allows us to execute Javascript outside of a web browser, this makes it very useful for backend/server code for web development.
NPM is a Javascript package manager that allows us to install a huge amount of different javascript libraries through simple console commands.

For example, here is a console command to install a package
`npm install packagename`

You can also add various parameters, for example:
`npm install packagename@latest`
will install the latest version of the specified package.

There are also extra arguments that you can append to the command, such as `--save`, and `--save-dev`
From my understanding, you use `--save` when you need to save a dependency that your app cannot run without, and you use `--save-dev` when the package is not absolutely required for the app to run, this is useful for packages that provide debug tools and other information like that. 

We have also started working through the Javascript and ReactJS Codecademy courses, I am finding them a lot tougher as I am generally not very skilled with Javascript, and am still trying to wrap my head around React and how it works compared to setting up javascript websites the 'old-fashioned' way.

I'm confident that with time I will get the hang of React, especially once we start writing code using it in class, I find that I learn things a lot better when I am doing them myself than when just learning about the fundamentals and theory behind it.
