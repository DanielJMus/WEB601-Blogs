# Week 8

This week we were shown how to create our own React app without using any templates or other preset files like we have in the past. This means we had to set up all of the files and folder structure ourselves.

Personally I much prefer creating all of the files myself rather than using any 'starter kits', I like to know exactly where everything is, why it's there,and what it's for in the first place, and a lot of templates add extra stuff that us beginners might not necessarily need at our current skill level, therefore adding clutter to the site as there might be features that we aren't utilizing. Making the app ourselves felt a lot more natural and has helped me memorize the file structure of a React app fairly well, and I'm confident that I could do it again without any guidance in the future.

We then installed the Live Server npm package, which hosts the site on a temporary server, I have started using live server in my own projects since being introduced to it as it features live reloading, meaning as soon as you save changes in the code, the site will update to reflect those changes, which I find extremely useful.
