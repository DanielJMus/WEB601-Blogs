# Week 12

This week we started working on Redux, Redux is a Javascript Library that is used to manage the state of the application, it is commonly used with React and even has its own package 'react-redux' that is designed for usage with them both. The main idea behind Redux is that the state that stores information on the application is read-only, meaning that in order to modify the state of the app you need to create Actions, which are executed by Reducers that handle the current and new state as it is changed.

Ali got us to work through some Redux introduction exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I struggled a little bit with some of the exercises as sometimes it felt unclear what you were supposed to do, but thankfully the site has a hint system implemented for when you get quite stuck, and I eventually got through all of the exercises. I can tell that I will definitely need more practice before I fully remember these things though.

Redux seems pretty intimidating to me personally, at least in terms of being able to implement it myself in an actual website rather than just a basic test UI. I'm sure I will get the hang of it over time though, just like I did with React.
